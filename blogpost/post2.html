			<h1 class="title pt-3"> Blog 2: The Simple Note App Version 1.0</h1>
            <h3>This blog is an overview of my first JS app that I made for a class assignment. Here is
				the link to the app <a href="../Hw3/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> </h3>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>This app is a simple note app that similar to the one on your phone that you can quickly write down important information without opening up a
				document editor. This is the very early design of this app with limited functionalities attached to it. The app so far can take in input from user
				and save it with local web storage and display it back to the screen. 
			</p>
			<h2>Development struggles</h2>
			<p>During the development of this app, I faced many new problems that was very frustrating at the time. The biggest problem to me was to efficiently
				use the local storage features to save my input and display it out to the screen with innerHTML command. It often fail to grab the user input and 
				give back a null value. Using the innerHTML to display item was also a learning curve for me, it did took me some time to push the item I wanted to
				the screen properly with it. 
			</p>
			<h2>Future improvements</h2>
			<p class="pb-2">For future version I want to make an actual storage system to where the note that was created will save and a user can make multiple notes as once and 
				can re-edit their previous saved note. I feel like that is an essential functions to the note app. ANother possible upgrade is to add a function to make 
				the app into a to-do list or shopping list where the user can cross-out item or check mark the note as they went through it.
